#Analysis and Forecasting of Gold Price Variations in the Indian Economy

Gold plays a significant role in India's economy, and its price is influenced by various economic factors such as inflation, GDP, and global demand. This analysis focuses on understanding the patterns and fluctuations in gold prices over time, identifying the key factors affecting these changes, and applying statistical models to forecast future prices.

This project aims to:

Analyze the historical variations in gold prices in India.
Understand the significance of different economic factors, such as inflation and GDP, on gold price fluctuations.
Apply appropriate forecasting techniques to predict future gold prices and compare their efficiency.

## Data Collection

The dataset consists of historical gold prices along with other relevant economic indicators like inflation and GDP. The data is used to build models that explain the relationship between these factors and the variations in gold prices.
Analysis Methods
Simple Linear Regression

A simple linear regression model is used to study the relationship between the year and gold prices in India. The results provide an initial understanding of how gold prices have changed over time.
Multiple Linear Regression

To gain deeper insights, a multiple linear regression model is applied, where gold prices are analyzed in relation to multiple factors, including inflation and GDP. This helps us understand the relative importance of these factors in driving gold price fluctuations.
Time Series Analysis

Gold prices are also treated as a time series to capture their temporal patterns. A time series plot is created to visualize trends and periodicity in the data. Furthermore, the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is used for forecasting future gold prices.
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Model

To explore non-linear relationships between the variables, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is trained using key factors like year, inflation, and GDP. The model helps capture complex interactions that are not easily explained by linear models.
Findings

 Historical Variations: The analysis shows a steady increase in gold prices over the years.
    Impact of Economic Factors: Multiple linear regression highlights that inflation and GDP significantly affect gold prices in addition to time.
    Forecasting: The ARIMA model indicates a continued upward trend in gold prices over the next five years, with a relatively accurate forecast.
    Comparison of Techniques: Among the different models, ARIMA provides efficient forecasting for time series data, while the ANN model helps capture non-linear relationships between gold prices and influencing factors.
    
Conclusion

This analysis highlights the factors that influence gold prices in India and offers insights into future price movements. By combining multiple techniques, including linear regression, time series analysis, and neural networks, we have created a robust framework for understanding and forecasting gold price variations. The study concludes that gold prices are likely to increase further in the coming years, driven by inflation, economic growth, and other external factors.
